Exam Preparation jQuery Tool
===

Takes a json file an prepars an exam based on that json. All external resources (js and css) are served via Google CDN but can be local if you cahnge the index.hmtl file.

To add new json exams copy the existing one and add a reference to the dropdown on the top-left of the page.

I made this so as my wife wounldn't roll her eyes when I asked for help with revision... hopefully it'll help you too.
